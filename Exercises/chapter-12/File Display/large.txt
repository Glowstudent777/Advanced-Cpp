Testing file display program.
This file has more than 24 lines.
It should trigger a pause.
Let's keep going...
More lines.
This is line six.
Another line.
And another one.
The program should pause soon.
Just checking how it handles scrolling.
More content.
Testing continues.
Almost halfway.
Hope this works as expected.
Getting closer to the pause.
Keep going.
Don't stop now.
Almost there.
A few more lines to go.
Will it pause?
Testing the logic.
Almost at 24 lines.
One more line.
This should pause here.

Now, let's continue.
More lines after the pause.
Everything should be working fine.
Just verifying the output.
The logic seems solid.
Almost done.
Wrapping it up.
Final test complete.
